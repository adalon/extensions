            <summary>
            Interface implemented by entities that need to 
            access the owning domain context to implement 
            their business logic.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Some aggregate roots may need to create and save 
            other aggregate roots in the context, and in order to do 
            it, they can implement this interface. Domain 
            context implementations should check for this interface 
            when the entities are being materialized or 
            constructed via <see cref="M:IDomainContext`1.New``1(System.Action{``0})"/> 
            to set the property value.

        <member name="T:IAggregateRoot`1">
            <summary>
            Base interface that must be implemented by all aggregate root entities. 
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This interface simply provides the <see cref="P:IAggregateRoot`1.IsDeleted"/> on top of 
            what <see cref="T:IIdentifiable`1"/> provides, enforcing the rule that that 
            aggregate are never deleted using the domain model, they are 
            simply marked as deleted.
            <para>
            Accessing the underlying context implementation though, aggregate 
            roots can be deleted anyway as usual in EF/NH (i.e. in migration scenarios, 
            tests, etc., it might be needed).

            Base interface that must be implented by all domain entities. 
            Types that do not have their separate table (a.k.a. "complex types" 
            in EF or "components" in NH) just don't implement this interface.

            <remarks>
            Although not strictly required, using this method for creating new 
            aggregate roots allows the context to perform additional initialization 
            if needed, such as injecting the <see cref="T:IDomainContext`1"/> into an 
            entity that implements <see cref="T:IDomainContextAccessor`1"/>, tracking 
            the entity changes, create a proxy for it, etc.
