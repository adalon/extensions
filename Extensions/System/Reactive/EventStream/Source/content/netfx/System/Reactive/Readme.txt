Both interfaces and implementation of the Event Stream are included in your 
project when using netfx-System.Reactive.EventStream package.

If you want to split the interfaces in another project, install the 
netfx-System.Reactive.EventStream.Interfaces package on your interfaces project, 
and netfx-System.Reactive.EventStream.Implementation on the implementation project.
